# GoodbyeSpam
This repository contains an Asterisk AGI (Asterisk Gateway Interface) script and an IVR (Interactive Voice Response) system designed to mitigate spam calls and robocalls on a Asterisk PBX by identifying and filtering out unwanted calls before reaching the client.

Features:
Blacklist: The AGI script immediately hangs up blacklisted callers.
IVR: Non-blacklisted callers are prompted to input the last digit of the extension they want to call using their dialpad to verify if they are human.

This was implemented as my Final Year Capstone Project in 2023
